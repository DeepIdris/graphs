Graphs

MIT License Java Platform

This project is about building a mapping application with the ability to provide and visualize routes from one point to another in a map. Mapping applications such as Google Maps have changed the way millions of people live. At the heart of these applications is a data structure called a graph.

Core Subjects
Class design to implement a graph in java
Basic graph search algorithms: depth-first search, breadth-first search, Dijkstra's algorithm, and A* search algorithm
Real-world geographic road data
Languages - Libraries - Tools
Java SE 8
Maven
Any IDE that supports JDK 8
Run Instructions
Download and unzip the project source code.
From a command line window, navigate to the (newly unzipped) project folder, and then run mvn clean install command.
To launch the application, run java -jar target/graphs-1.0.jar.
You're now ready to freely play around with different graph search algorithms, and visualize how they work in a route planning application.
